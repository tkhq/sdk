# Example: `with-solana`

This example walks through the following:

- Creation of a new Turnkey wallet with a new Solana account
- Monitoring of devnet tokens landing on that address
- Construction of a transaction sending the funds out with the `@turnkey/solana` signer
- Creating, minting, and transferring a SPL token using Turnkey

You can try this example quickly on Stackblitz. Follow the instructions below --> [Stackblitz Instructions](#7-stackblitz-example)

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-solana/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `ORGANIZATION_ID`

You can specify an existing Turnkey Solana address if you have one already:

```
SOLANA_ADDRESS=<your Turnkey Solana address>
```

Note that this is optional: the script gives you a fresh one if you don't specify one in your `.env.local` file.

### 3/ Running the script

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
creating a new Solana wallet in your Turnkey organization...

New Solana wallet created!
- Name: Solana Wallet 6527
- Wallet ID: 7f0f7d49-22e3-5b34-8192-db3df83a0759
- Solana address: G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp

Your new Solana address: "G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp"

ðŸ’¸ Your onchain balance is at 0! To continue this demo you'll need devnet funds! You can use:
- The faucet in this example: `pnpm run faucet`
- The official Solana CLI: `solana airdrop 1 G6fEj2pt4YYAxLS8JAsY5BL6hea7Fpe8Xyqscg2e7pgp`
- Any online faucet (e.g. https://faucet.solana.com/)

```

Note: if you have a consensus-related policy resembling the following

```
{
  "effect": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
  "consensus": "approvers.count() >= 2"
}
```

then the script will await consensus to be met. Specifically, the script will attempt to poll for activity completion per the `activityPoller` config passed to the `TurnkeyServerSDK`. If consensus still isn't met during this period, then the resulting `Consensus Needed` error will be caught, and the script will prompt the user to indicate when consensus has been met. At that point, the script will continue.

### 4/ Running the advanced script (multiple versioned transactions)

```bash
$ pnpm advanced
```

The output will resemble the following:

```

### 5/ Running the SPL token script (create, mint, transfer)

```bash
$ pnpm token-transfer
```

The output will resemble the following:

### 6/ Running the "Create SPL token transfer with policy" example

This example shows the flow of using our policy engine's support for SPL token transfers! Specifically we show how to allow a user (non root user) to send a Solana SPL token transfer by calculating the "associated token address" of the receiving account, given the mint address of the token that we are transferring.

To best see how policies can be used effectively, we will go through example in the following steps

1. Setup - this step creates the on-chain state and SOME of the Turnkey setup state required to make this transfer (notably, it leaves out the creation of the policy that allows the created non root user to sign the SPL transfer)
2. Attempt Transfer - since we're attempting the transfer WITHOUT having created the policy allowing it, this will fail
3. Create Token Policy - this will create a policy that allows Solana transactions initiated by the correct user to be signed if they contain a single instruction which is an SPL token transfer to the correct token account
4. Attempt Transfer (again) - this will succeed, now that the appropriate policy has been created!

NOTE: A very key piece of understanding to glean from this example is the use of "associated token addresses (or "associated token account address") in the creation of SPL related policies. For further context on ATA's look here: https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account

#### Step 1. Setup

First we will run the setup command

```bash
$ pnpm token-transfer-policy setup
```

This will create a Solana wallet address that you'll have to fund with devnet SOL via a faucet or cli. A commonly used SOL devnet faucet is available here --> https://faucet.solana.com/

Funding your devnet and hitting `y` in the terminal to proceed will set up the necessary on-chain state and Turnkey setup to start, and will output the following information to be used in coming steps

- Turnkey Solana wallet address
- Token Mint public key
- Non root user created with user id

```bash

New user created!
- Name: Non Root User
- User ID: 13c4609b-8818-40be-aeac-c8b63da0de4a

Setup complete -- token mint and token accounts created, non root user created
Turnkey Solana wallet address: 2bwUkGZ72SNyzBWFwfzKVrVWJ9JNZggjqFPDM9X9mrp9
Token Mint public key: FA7umztm6eYcENE22ndEZhd8MCf9C7myJ2KjfCwobj8F
Non root user created with user id: 13c4609b-8818-40be-aeac-c8b63da0de4a
```

#### Step 2. Attempt to Transfer Tokens (This is expected to FAIL)

We will now attempt to transfer these SPL tokens that we've created

```bash
$ pnpm token-transfer-policy attempt-transfer
```

This will prompt you first to enter in the Solana wallet address that is originating the transfer (use the address labeled "Turnkey Solana wallet address" output at the end of the setup step)

```bash
? Enter Solana wallet address originating transfer (created during setup stage):
```

Once you've entered your wallet address you will then be prompted to enter in the Mint address/public key for the token being transferred (use the address labeled "Token Mint public key" output at the end of the setup step)

```bash
? Enter Mint account address of token being transferred (created during setup stage):
```

Since this is being initiated by a non root user, and the policy allowing this has not been created, this is EXPECTED TO FAIL. You will get an error that includes the following information saying that no policies evaluated to the outcome: Allow

```bash
details: [
    {
      '@type': 'type.googleapis.com/errors.v1.PolicyEnginePermissionError',
      message: 'No policies evaluated to outcome: Allow',
      policyEvaluations: []
    }
  ],
  code: 7
```

#### Step 3. Create Policy allowing the correct user to make SPL transfers to receiving Associated Token Address

This is the most important step! In this step we are taking our receiving address (the Turnkey Warchest), calculating it's "associated token address", given the Mint account address for the token we've created, and creating a policy that allows the correct non root user to sign Solana transactions if and only if they contain a single instruction that is an SPL token transfer to this associated token address.

```bash
$ pnpm token-transfer-policy create-token-policy
```

This will prompt you first to enter in the user ID of the non root user who's credentials are being used to sign the transfer (use the value labeled "Non root user created with user id" output at the end of the setup step)

```bash
? Enter non-root user ID originating the transfer (created during setup stage):
```

Once you've entered this user id, you will then be prompted to enter in the Mint address/public key for the token being transferred (use the address labeled "Token Mint public key" output at the end of the setup step)

```bash
? Enter Mint account address of token being transferred (created during setup stage):
```

This should successfully create your policy!

```bash
New policy created!
- Name: Let non root user send SPL transfers to the associated token account of WARCHEST: 6nDvKk6emwskFLtEpbQgFX6rsMtzbNY4LkvaNnzkvBaq given the mint address for the token just created
- Policy ID: f715fda0-2236-4904-b4be-9098f7c192b8
- Effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
- Consensus: approvers.any(user, user.id == '96a10eb7-0389-447e-bc50-b768a76c0d7f')
- Condition: solana.tx.instructions.count() == 1 && solana.tx.spl_transfers.any(transfer, transfer.to == '6nDvKk6emwskFLtEpbQgFX6rsMtzbNY4LkvaNnzkvBaq')
```

#### Step 4. Attempt to Transfer Tokens (This is expected to SUCCEED)

Following the instructions for step 2 above should find success this time -- showing that the policy has successfully allowed the user to transfer tokens!

```bash
Broadcasting token transfer transaction...
Transaction broadcast and confirmed! ðŸŽ‰
