# Example: Gas Station with Turnkey

This example demonstrates how to implement gasless transactions using the Turnkey Gas Station SDK with EIP-7702 authorization. Users can execute on-chain transactions without holding ETH for gas - your paymaster covers the cost.

For complete API documentation, architecture details, and security best practices, see the **[@turnkey/gas-station package README](../../packages/gas-station/README.md)**.

## What This Example Shows

- **ETH Transfer**: Gasless ETH transfer from user wallet to recipient
- **USDC Transfer**: Gasless ERC-20 token transfer using EIP-7702 delegation
- **Turnkey Integration**: Secure key management for both user and paymaster wallets
- **Policy Enforcement**: Tests demonstrating Turnkey policy restrictions

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
cd sdk/
corepack enable
pnpm install -r
pnpm run build-all
cd examples/tk-gas-station/
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
# Turnkey Configuration
BASE_URL=https://api.turnkey.com
API_PRIVATE_KEY=your_turnkey_api_private_key
API_PUBLIC_KEY=your_turnkey_api_public_key
ORGANIZATION_ID=your_turnkey_organization_id

# Wallet Addresses
EOA_ADDRESS=0x...                            # User's wallet address
PAYMASTER_ADDRESS=0x...                      # Your paymaster address

# RPC Configuration
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...

# Gas Station Contracts (Optional - defaults to deterministic addresses)
DELEGATE_CONTRACT=0x33619C1BfB3956a00DDA34FdbF7c3138B6244Aa2    # EIP-7702 delegate contract
EXECUTION_CONTRACT=0xe511AD0a281C10b8408381E2Ab8525abE587827b   # Gas Sponsorship entrypoint contract which calls the delegate.
```

**Note**: The gas station contracts are deployed at deterministic addresses on Ethereum Mainnet and Base Mainnet. These are built into the SDK, so you only need to specify them for custom deployments.

### 3. Run Examples

```bash
# Gasless ETH transfer on Base
pnpm run eth-transfer -- --chain base

# Gasless USDC transfer on Base
pnpm run usdc-transfer -- --chain base

# Run policy enforcement tests
pnpm run test:policies
```

## Example Code Walkthrough

### ETH Transfer (`src/transferETHDelegated.ts`)

Demonstrates a complete flow for gasless ETH transfers:

1. **Initialize Turnkey clients** for user and paymaster
2. **One-time authorization** via EIP-7702 (if not already authorized)
3. **Create and sign intent** off-chain using EIP-712
4. **Execute transaction** with paymaster covering gas costs

Key code snippet:

```typescript
// User creates and signs intent off-chain
const nonce = await userClient.getNonce();
const intent = await userClient
  .createIntent()
  .transferETH(recipientAddress, parseEther("0.01"))
  .sign(nonce);

// Paymaster executes and pays for gas
const result = await paymasterClient.execute(intent);
console.log(`âœ… Transaction: ${result.txHash}`);
console.log(`ðŸ”— Explorer: https://basescan.org/tx/${result.txHash}`);
```

### USDC Transfer (`src/transferUSDCDelegated.ts`)

Similar flow but for ERC-20 token transfers:

```typescript
const nonce = await userClient.getNonce();
const intent = await userClient
  .createIntent()
  .transferToken(
    usdcAddress,
    recipientAddress,
    parseUnits("10", 6) // 10 USDC
  )
  .sign(nonce);

await paymasterClient.execute(intent);
```

### Policy Enforcement Tests (`src/__tests__/policyEnforcement.test.ts`)

Demonstrates how Turnkey policies restrict what transactions can be signed:

- **EOA policies**: Restrict which contracts and amounts the user can sign
- **Paymaster policies**: Restrict which transactions the paymaster can execute
- **Defense in depth**: Combine both policy layers for maximum security

## Architecture Overview

```
User (EOA)
  â†“ Signs EIP-712 intent off-chain (no gas needed)
  â†“
Paymaster
  â†“ Submits transaction, pays gas
  â†“
Gas Station Contract (EIP-7702)
  â†“ Validates signature & nonce
  â†“ Executes on behalf of EOA
  â†“
Target Contract (Transfer ETH/USDC/etc)
```

## Key Features

- **No ETH Required**: Users don't need ETH to execute transactions
- **Secure**: All keys managed by Turnkey, signatures validated on-chain
- **Flexible**: Works with any contract call, not just transfers
- **Production-Ready**: Includes policy enforcement and security best practices

## Chain Support

This example works on:

- **Base Mainnet** (default in examples)
- **Ethereum Mainnet**
- Any EVM chain where the gas station contracts are deployed

## Troubleshooting

### "Authorization failed"

- Ensure your paymaster wallet has ETH for gas
- Verify the delegate contract address is correct

### "Execution failed"

- Confirm the EOA is authorized (run authorization step first)
- Check that nonce hasn't been reused
- Verify the user wallet has sufficient token balance
