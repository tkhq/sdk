# Example: `with-ethers`

This example shows how to construct and broadcast a transaction using [`Ethers`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/) with Turnkey.

If you want to see a demo with passkeys, head to the example [`with-ethers-and-passkeys`](../with-ethers-and-passkeys/) to see a NextJS app using passkeys.

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v16+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-ethers/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID
- A Turnkey wallet account (address), private key address, or a private key ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `SIGN_WITH` -- a Turnkey wallet account address, private key address, or private key ID. If you leave this blank, we'll create a wallet for you.
- `INFURA_KEY` -- if this is not set, it will default to using the Community Infura key

### 3/ Running the scripts

Note: there are multiple scripts included. See `package.json` for all of them. The following is the default:

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

This script will do the following:

1. sign a raw payload
2. send ETH (via type 2 EIP-1559 transaction)
3. deposit ETH into the WETH contract (aka wrapping)

Note that these transactions will all be broadcasted sequentially.

The script constructs a transaction via Turnkey and broadcasts via Infura. If the script exits because your account isn't funded, you can request funds on https://goerlifaucet.com/ or https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/.

```bash
$ pnpm start-legacy-sepolia
```

This script will do the following:

1. send ETH (via type 0, EIP-155-compliant legacy transaction)
2. deposit ETH into the WETH contract (aka wrapping)

Note that these transactions will all be broadcasted sequentially. Additionally, Ethers v5 is only compatible with the Sepolia network if paired with Infura (Ethers v5 does not supported Alchemy with Sepolia at this time).

The script constructs a transaction via Turnkey and broadcasts via Infura. If the script exits because your account isn't funded, you can request funds on https://sepoliafaucet.com/ or via Coinbase Wallet.
