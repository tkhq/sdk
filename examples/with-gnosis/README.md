# Example: `with-gnosis`

This example shows how to create new Ethereum addresses via Turnkey, configure a 3/3 Gnosis safe, and create, sign, and execute a transaction from it.

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v16+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/with-gnosis/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID
- Three wallet account addresses, private key addresses, or private keys

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `SIGN_WITH_1 / 2 / 3` -- 3 Turnkey wallet account addresses, private key addresses, or private key IDs. If you leave any of these blank, we'll create a wallet with 3 wallet accounts for you.
- `INFURA_KEY` -- if this is not set, it will default to using the Community Infura key

### 3/ Running the scripts

```bash
$ pnpm start
```

By default, this script will do the following:

1. Create a new Gnosis Safe (e.g. 3/3 multisig)
2. Initiate a Safe transaction
3. Approve transaction using offchain EIP-712 signature
4. Approve transaction using offchain raw signed message signature
5. Approve transaction onchain
6. Execute transaction once all approvals have been obtained

NOTES:

- If the script exits because your account isn't funded, you can request funds via https://sepoliafaucet.com/ or Coinbase Wallet (developer settings).
- Transactions will all be broadcasted sequentially.
- For this example, we recommend the usage of Sepolia + Infura specifically: we've experienced more consistent performance for this example on Sepolia, which is not supported by the Alchemy provider in Ethers v5.
