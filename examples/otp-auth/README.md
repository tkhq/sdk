# Example: `otp-auth`

This example shows a complete OTP auth flow. It contains a NextJS app with:

- a frontend application
- a backend application

This example contains an example auth page as well as a stub API endpoint for "your business" (where the contact is resolved into an organization ID). It relies on the `indexedDbClient` to stamp the requests. For more information on OTP auth, [check out our documentation](https://docs.turnkey.com/features/otp-auth).

## Getting started

### 1/ Cloning the example

Make sure you have `node` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk
$ cd sdk/
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install -r  # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build-all  # Compile source code
$ cd examples/otp-auth/
```

### 2/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID
- A user with an email and permissions to create a wallet (your root user will have full permissions by default)

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (the `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix makes the env variable accessible to the frontend app)

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will run a NextJS app on port 3000. If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you can follow the prompts to start an OTP auth.
