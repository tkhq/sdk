# Example: `with-eth-passkey-signers`

This repo contains a sample application **for demonstration purposes only**, walking through how to create sub-organizations, create wallets, and sign with the [`@turnkey/viem`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem) or [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/ethers) signer, using passkeys. Please feel free play around and file an issue if there are improvements to be made! ❤️

The flow showcases 3 ways to make requests to Turnkey:

- the initial request to create a new [sub-organization](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/sub-organizations) is authenticated in the NextJS backend with an API signature (using `API_PUBLIC_KEY`/`API_PRIVATE_KEY` from your `.env.local` file)
- the request to log back in is signed on the frontend with your passkey, but it's passed to the NextJS backend as a signed request (the body, stamp, and url are POSTed). This lets the backend submit this request on your behalf, get your sub-organization ID, and fetch details about your wallet (parent organizations have read-only access to their sub-organizations).
- the request to sign a message is done 100% client-side via a Turnkey Viem or Ethers signer (see [@turnkey/viem](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/viem) and [@turnkey/ethers](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/ethers), respectively): it's signed with your passkey, and submitted from the browser to the Turnkey API directly.

If you want to see a Viem or Ethers demo with API keys instead of passkeys, see these examples: [`with-viem`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-viem), [`with-ethers`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-ethers). See our [SDK repo](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk) for additional packages and examples.

You can try this example quickly on Stackblitz. Follow the instructions below --> [Stackblitz Instructions](#4-stackblitz-example)

## Getting started

### 1/ Clone or fork this repo

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed locally; we recommend using Node v18+.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tkhq/sdk.git
$ cd sdk/examples/with-
$ corepack enable  # Install `pnpm`
$ pnpm install # Install dependencies
$ pnpm run build  # Compile source code
```

### 2a/ Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

- A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
- An organization ID

### 2b/ Setting up Biconomy (optional)

If you would like to use [account abstraction](https://docs.turnkey.com/reference/aa-wallets) to power experiences where end-users have their transactions paid for, the next step is to navigate to Biconomy to create a paymaster. Visit the [Biconomy Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/) to create a your paymaster and find the following:

- Bundler URL
- Paymaster API Key

If these parameters are _not_ provided, the application will default to using the Turnkey-provided EOA as the sender address.

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_KEY` -- if this is not set, it will default to using the Community Infura key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BICONOMY_BUNDLER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BICONOMY_PAYMASTER_API_KEY`

### 3/ Running the app

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This command will start a NextJS app on localhost. If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser, you can follow the prompts to create a sub organization, create a private key for the newly created sub-organization, and sign a message using your passkey with a Viem custom account, or Ethers signer!

### 4/ Stackblitz Example

Example Link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-2psu3g

#### Prerequisites

To use the example you need the following

- Turnkey Organization
- API key for the root user (both public and private key needed)

#### Set Env Variables

Set the following environment variables in the `.env.local` file

- `API_PUBLIC_KEY` --> Set this to be the public key of the API key for the root user for the org you've created
- `API_PRIVATE_KEY` --> Set this to be the private key of the API key for the root user for the org you've created
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID` --> Set this to be the Org ID of the org you've created
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` --> This will be preset with https://api.turnkey.com
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPID` --> this should be pre-filled with the value `local-credentialless.webcontainer.io` which is the RPID required in the Stackblitz environment
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_SIGN_URL` → fill this out with the url in the browser of Stackblitz followed by “/api” --> for example: https://stackblitzstartersh5pmnu-0bej--3000--134daa3c.local-credentialless.webcontainer.io/api. This needs to be replaced as in the note below

NOTE: when you update `.env.local` file (or any file) in Stackblitz, the project will get forked and a new Stackblitz environment will get created. This means that you'll have to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_SIGN_URL` will have to be updated to be the Stackblitz environment browser URL + the suffix "/api"

#### Directions to use

- run `npm install && npm run dev`
- follow the example's flow
