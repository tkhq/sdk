# Turnkey SDK

[![js-build](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/actions/workflows/js-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/actions/workflows/js-build.yml)

## Overview

The Turnkey SDK includes functionality to interact with Turnkey in various contexts and ecosystems. It consists of three main NPM package groups.

- the [Primary Turnkey Web SDK Packages](#primary-turnkey-web-sdk-packages) which expose the main functionality required to build Turnkey-powered applications in different web environments
- the [Chain/Ecosystem-Specific Signing Packages](#chainecosystem-specific-signing-sdk-packages) which expose signers with support for specific ecosystems, built on top of our Web SDK packages
- the [Advanced Functionality SDK Packages](#advanced-functionality-sdk-packages) which exposes lower level functionality that is leveraged by our Primary Web SDK Packages for those with highly-specific implementations looking to use them.

The diagram below helps visualize the packages in our SDK organized by the functionality they expose.

## Primary Turnkey Web SDK Packages

The following packages expose the main functionality required to build Turnkey-powered applications. Each package exposes functions, and/or client classes with methods that manage the process of authenticating requests to the Turnkey API in the contexts of a generic browser environment or react client environment, or a server environment.

While these higher level packages are the main points of reference to be used while designing and building Turnkey applications, they wrap other packages with lower level functionality which we also expose separately for those who would like to explore them for more specialized use cases. These packages are listed and described below in the [Advanced Functionality SDK Packages](#advanced-functionality-sdk-packages) section.

Our main web SDK packages are as follows:

| Package                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | NPM                                                                                                                           | Changelog                                       | Docs                                                     |

| [@turnkey/sdk-browser](/packages/sdk-browser)                                    | The `@turnkey/sdk-browser` package exposes functionality that lets developers build browser based applications that interact with the Turnkey API with different types of authentication. It consists of different clients that enable requests to the API to be authenticated via different auth methods like user sessions, passkeys and iFrames. It also contains methods to manage information and state related to authentication like auth bundles and sessions, retrieving user information and server signing API requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@turnkey/http?color=%234C48FF)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-browser)      | [CHANGELOG](/packages/sdk-browser/CHANGELOG.md) | [Docs](https://docs.turnkey.com/sdks/javascript-browser) |
| [@turnkey/sdk-server](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk-server) | The `@turnkey/sdk-server` package exposes functionality that lets developers build server-side functionality for applications that interact with the Turnkey API with different types of authentication â€“ allowing applications to authenticate users, manage sessions, and perform organizational operations securely and efficiently. It consists of an API Client and API Proxies that enable requests to the Turnkey API to be authenticated with the appropriate credentials. Specifically, the API Client manages requests signed by the user's authentication details, and the API proxies handle requests signed by the parent organization's authentication details. Use this package to handle server-side interactions for applications that interact with the Turnkey API. | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@turnkey/sdk-server?color=%234C48FF)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-server) | [CHANGELOG](/packages/sdk-server/CHANGELOG.md)  | [Docs](https://docs.turnkey.com/sdks/javascript-server)  |
| [@turnkey/sdk-react](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/sdk-react)   | The `@turnkey/sdk-react` package wraps the functionality from the `@turnkey/sdk-browser` package to allow developers to build react based applications that interact with the Turnkey API with different types of authentication. It allows developers to use the same clients exposed in `@turnkey/sdk-browser` that enable requests to the API to be authenticated via different auth methods like user sessions, passkey and iFrames. It also contains the same methods to manage information and state related to authentication like auth bundles and sessions, retrieving user information and server signing API requests. Use this package when you're building React-based frontend applications that interact with the Turnkey API.                                          | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@turnkey/sdk-react?color=%234C48FF)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/sdk-react)   | [CHANGELOG](/packages/sdk-react/CHANGELOG.md)   | [Docs](https://docs.turnkey.com/sdks/react)              |

The diagram below helps visualize how each package can be used to devlop the appropriate service in your Turnkey Powered Application, and how Turnkey requests would flow between those services.

## Chain/Ecosystem-Specific Signing SDK Packages

The following packages contain chain or ecosystem specific signers that take some of our [Primary Turnkey Web SDK Packages](#primary-turnkey-web-sdk-packages) (usually @turnkey/sdk-browser or @turnkey/sdk-server) and add additional support based on the signing process or transaction structure relevant to that specific chain or ecosystem.

## Advanced Functionality SDK Packages

For those with more specialized use cases, Turnkey exposes it's lower level-libraries stamping and encryption libraries to be used directly. Note: for most use-cases, these libraries are not meant to be used directly and we encourage working on designing your application mainlyusing our [Primary Turnkey Web SDK Packages](#primary-turnkey-web-sdk-packages) along with our [Chain and Ecosystem Specific SDK Packages](#chainecosystem-specific-signing-sdk-packages) as per your use case!

## Demos built with Turnkey

### Demo Consumer Wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-consumer-wallet))

A minimal consumer wallet app powered by Turnkey. Behind the scenes, it uses [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/ethers) for signing and WalletConnect (v1) for accessing dapps.

See https://github.com/tkhq/demo-consumer-wallet for the code.

### Demo Passkey Wallet ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-passkey-wallet), [live link](https://wallet.tx.xyz))

A wallet application showing how users can register and authenticate using passkeys.
This demo uses the Turnkey API to create a new [Turnkey Sub-Organization](https://docs.turnkey.com/concepts/sub-organizations) for each user, create a testnet Ethereum address and send a transaction on Sepolia (ETH testnet).

### Demo Ethers Passkeys ([code](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ethers-passkeys))

A simple application demonstrating how to create sub-organizations, create private keys, and sign with the [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/ethers) signer, using passkeys.
