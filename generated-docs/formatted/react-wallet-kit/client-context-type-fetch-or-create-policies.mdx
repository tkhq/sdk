<H3Bordered text="Overview" />

Fetches each requested policy if it exists, or creates it if it does not.

<ul>
  <li>This function is idempotent: multiple calls with the same policies will not create duplicates.</li>
  <li>For every policy in the request:</li>
  <li>If it already exists, it is returned with its ``policyId``.</li>
  <li>If it does not exist, it is created and returned with its new ``policyId``.</li>
</ul>
