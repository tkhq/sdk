# Variable: ClientProvider

> `const` **ClientProvider**: `React.FC`\<\{ `callbacks`: `TurnkeyCallbacks`; `children`: `ReactNode`; `config`: `TurnkeyProviderConfig`; \}\>

Defined in: [react-wallet-kit/src/providers/client/Provider.tsx:116](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/blob/main/packages/react-wallet-kit/src/providers/client/Provider.tsx#L116)

Provides Turnkey client authentication, session management, wallet operations, and user profile management
for the React Wallet Kit SDK. This context provider encapsulates all core authentication flows (Passkey, Wallet, OTP, OAuth),
session lifecycle (creation, expiration, refresh), wallet linking/import/export, and user profile updates (email, phone, name).

The provider automatically initializes the Turnkey client, fetches configuration (including proxy auth config if needed),
and synchronizes session and authentication state. It exposes a comprehensive set of methods for authentication flows,
wallet management, and user profile operations, as well as UI handlers for modal-driven flows.

Features:
- Passkey, Wallet, OTP (Email/SMS), and OAuth (Google, Apple, Facebook) authentication and sign-up flows.
- Session management: creation, expiration scheduling, refresh, and clearing.
- Wallet management: fetch, link, import, export, account management.
- User profile management: email, phone, name, OAuth provider, and passkey linking/removal.
- Modal-driven UI flows for authentication, wallet linking, and profile updates.
- Error handling and callback integration for custom error and event responses.

Usage:
Wrap your application with `TurnkeyProvider` to enable authentication and wallet features via context.
