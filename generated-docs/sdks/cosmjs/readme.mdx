Experimental [Turnkey](https://turnkey.com) Cosmos Signer for [`CosmJS`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs):

- `TurnkeyDirectWallet` is a drop-in replacement for [`DirectSecp256k1Wallet`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/e8e65aa0c145616ccb58625c32bffe08b46ff574/packages/proto-signing/src/directsecp256k1wallet.ts#LL14C14-L14C35) that conforms to the `OfflineDirectSigner` interface.
